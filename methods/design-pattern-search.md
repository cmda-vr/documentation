# Design Pattern Search

**Why?**:  
*Find common solutions for recurring problems and a description of the context in which these solutions work best.*

**How**:  
> Pattern collections are found in online repositories and books focusing on certain topics.

## Standards

> One of my favorite things about #VR development with @aframevr is the blank slate for user interface design. There are no  standards or expectations in a brand new medium.

## Terminology
Most VR experiences involve another crucial component: inter- action. Does the sensory stimulation depend on actions taken by the organism? If the answer is “no”, then the VR system is called open-loop: otherwise, it is closed-loop. In the case of closed-loop VR, the organism has partial control over the stimulation, which could vary as a result of body motions, including eyes, head, hands, or legs. Other possibilities include voice commands, heart rate, body temperature, and skin conductance (are you sweating?).

## Hardware
* **Drop-in viewers:** turn your smartphone into a VR box (cardboard etc.). Drop the smartphone into a viewer with lenses.


## Interaction

### Patterns
List and overview of common patterns and interaction methods inside virtual Reality.

### Actions
When possible, we designed more than one way to accomplish something. This redundant interaction approach aimed to give people the option to use what is most comfortable for them to accomplish the most common tasks.

### Events
* **Progessive enhancement:** what if a person doesn't have a hdm. What's the enhancement? They can look around with mouse and keyboard. Then gradually improve to input.
* **Gaze tracking:** looking with an arrow in the middle for a timeout to select items on the screen without input.
* **Fuse buttons:** Virtual buttons that leverage a timer, or fuse, which trigger after the user has focused on them for a certain amount of time. When creating fuse buttons, always give the user the option to directly and immediately click on the target. Avoid placing fuse buttons in close proximity to each other. Fuse buttons work best if they are large targets that are sufficiently far apart from each other. 

### Menus
However, Immersive Design poses an interesting question: where does the line between content and UI start and end?

As they envision a world to be inhabited by players, the interface to navigate it can often be abstracted into menus that live outside the world’s logic.

Although some games rely on the traditional 2D menu systems, others place cues in the environment to educate the user.
