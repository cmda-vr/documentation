# Design Pattern Search

**Why?**:  
*Find common solutions for recurring problems and a description of the context in which these solutions work best.*

**How**:  
> Pattern collections are found in online repositories and books focusing on certain topics.

## Standards

> One of my favorite things about #VR development with @aframevr is the blank slate for user interface design. There are no  standards or expectations in a brand new medium.
