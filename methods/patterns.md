Most VR experiences involve another crucial component: inter- action. Does the sensory stimulation depend on actions taken by the organism? If the answer is “no”, then the VR system is called open-loop; otherwise, it is closed-loop. In the case of closed-loop VR, the organism has partial control over the stimulation, which could vary as a result of body motions, including eyes, head, hands, or legs. Other possibilities include voice commands, heart rate, body temperature, and skin conductance (are you sweating?).

When a scientist designs an experiment for an organism, as shown in Figure 1.2, then the separation is clear: The laboratory subject (organism) has a first-person experience, while the scientist is a third-person observer.

Drop-in viewers.

Gaze tracking.

360 videos; The tricks of the trade that were learned across the 20th century need to be reinvestigated because they are based on the assumption that the cinematographer controls the camera viewpoint. In VR, viewers can look in any direction, and perhaps even walk through the scene.

Progessive enhancement: what if a person doesn't have a hdm. What's the enhancement? They can look around with mouse and keyboard. Then gradually improve to input.
