# Learning Virtual Reality

> Cardboard can be first VR experience for many people.

> We can use web technologies to create applications. Faster to code and more cross-platform. Second; it affords us access to all of the existing infrastructure the Web has to offer. (hyperlinks, hosting etc.)

## Preface

This medium allows consumers to experience VR with affordable systems. Since the Oculus acquisition tech companies invested millions in the platform. The book is pretty broad, no too in-depth.

## Chapter 1 - Introduction
The ability to be transported to other places, to be fully immersed in the present. Consumer grade VR hardware is young, each offers a different experience with different price points.

The feeling of total immersion is what we are striving for with virtual reality.

### What is Virtual Reality?
Virtual reality has one goal; to convince you that you are somewhere else. It's doing this by tricking the brain. A variety of technologies achieve this;
* Stereoscopic displays; 3d displays (head-mounted displays). Produce stereo image that our eyes interpret as having three-dimensional depth.
* Motion tracking hardware; low cost components to sense when our bodies move and our heads turn, so we can update the view.
* Input devices; game controllers, body-tracking sensors etc.
* Desktop and mobile platforms; Computer hardware and operating systems.

You can achieve full immersion with most of these four components.

#### Stereoscopic Displays
This is the main ingredient in VR, 3D visual representation of the experience that conveys a sense of depth. One of the biggest inpediments to consumer-grade virtual reality was an affordable display.

Generate image for seperate eye, one slightly offset from the other to simulate parallex. From a softwware point of view, an hedset's job is to render an image a minimum of 60 and ideally 120 times per second.

#### Motion Tracking Hardware
Track the movement of the head. Inertial measurement unit (UMI), measure changes in rotation. Our perceptual systems are very sensitive to motion.

#### Input devices
Head-mounted displays enclose the user's eyes, they have to 'fly blind'. We don't use mouse and keyboard, we have alternative game controllers.

#### Computing platforms
Our existing computers and devices can be turned into virtual reality boxes simply by adding a few peripherals.

* Most VR developers build their apps using game middleware like Unity3D. (Middleware engines, IDE's)
* We can use web technologies to create applications. Faster to code and more cross-platform. Second; it affords us access to all of the existing infrastructure the Web has to offer. (hyperlinks, hosting etc.)
* Video players represent a whole class of virtual reality technology by itself, it is a copy of the real world.

### Virtual Reality Applications
* Video games are pretty obvious.
* Virtual worlds; socual user-generated persistent virtual worlds.
* Education; Interactive learning.
* Productivity; 360 workspace instead of computer
* Tourism; panoramas
* Architecture; Showing models and existing properties.
* Live events; VR video for concerts and live events.
* Web browsing; Navigate the web using VR.
* Enterprise; simulation, training etc.

## Chapter 2 - Virtual Reality Hardware
This is a rapidly evolving industry. New head-mounted displays are coming out all the time.

### Oculus Rift
It spaned an entire VR industry, first consumer market. 
* DK1; low resolution
* DK2; positional head tracking with camera

*CV1 is the difference between experiencing the promise of vr and actually experiencing it.*

### Samsung Gear VR
Gear VR is a partnetship with Oculus. The technology has been incorporated into the Gear VR. If you own a Samsung smartphone this is one of the best Mobile options. You develop with the Mobile SDK.

### Google Cardboard / Cardboard VR
Using and buying hardware is a major commitment. The most low-cost way is turning your existing smartphone into a VR box. It isn't as deep as immersive as expensive hardware but can be the first VR experience for many people. 

Cardboard simply refers to the technique of dropping a smartphone into a box with lenses. Head tracking for Cardboard is pretty straightforward, it uses the existing operatin system orientation events.

#### Input
Cardboard VR inut is wip, the phone is encased so you can't use touch.

## VR Input Devices
User input poses a new set of challenges in VR system design.
* Game controllers
* Hand tracking; motion input sensors. Low-cost motion devices. Leap motion e.g. Combination of cameras and infrared LEDs.
* Wireless hand and body trackers; 

Virtual reality is also pushing the envelope on user input. VR displays cut the user off completely from the outside world.
