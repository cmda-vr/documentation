# Virtual Reality

## Chapter 1
When an animal explores its environment, neural structures composed of place cells are formed that encode spatial information about its surroundings [14, 15]: see Figure 1.3(a). Each place cell is activated precisely when the organism returns to a particular location that is covered by it. Although less understood, grid cells even encode locations in a manner similar to Cartesian coordinates [13] (Figure 1.3(b)). It has been shown that these neural structures may form in an organism, even when having a VR experience [1, 4, 9]. In other words, our brains may form place cells for places that are not real! This is a clear indication that VR is fooling our brains, at least partially.
