# Best, good and Bad Practices

## WebVR guidelines

* **Present VR on page load;** Many VR sites are focused on the traditional 2D Web. Someone navigates to a page, waits for a loading spinner, clicks several buttons, and only then it enters VR mode. We need less 2D loading screens.
* **Handle link traversel;** Link traversal allows for us to remain in VR as we navigate from site to site.
* **Add audio;** Add any form of audio, anything is better then complete silence.
